# FlickrViewer 
Project Overview:    
Project that allows users to search and view different pictures uploaded to the Flickr API.    

In this project I created a Flickr Viewer app that allows users to search for photos on the photo-sharing website Flickr then browse through the result. The app uses an ansynchronous method to invoke a Flickr web service. The Flickr Viewer app also allows the user to search via tag for photos that users worldwide have uploaded to Flickr. I achieve this by invoking the Flickr web service's method (flickr.photos.search.) using RESTful services.
